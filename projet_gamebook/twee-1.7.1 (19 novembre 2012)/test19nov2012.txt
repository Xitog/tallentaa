:: One Passage
This is the body of a single passage. A passage title is set off by two colons at the start of a line.

You can place line breaks directly in the passage text.

:: A Second Passage [tag1 tag2]
You can leave as much space as you like between passages. Enclose tags with single square brackets on the same line as the passage title, separating them with spaces.
