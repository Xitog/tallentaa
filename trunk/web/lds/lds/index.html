        <p><img src="./puce2.png" align="bottom" alt=""/>Looking Dwarf is a <em>fictitious</em> company of only one person giving away some stuff. This stuff is not the boldest, best or whateverest of the world, but with some luck -and to our great delight- you <i>could</i> find something useful here.</p>
        <p><img src="./puce2.png" align="bottom" alt=""/>Looking Dwarf has currently two branches, one for Video Games and other computer-related things, called Looking Dwarf Software -or <b>LDS</b> for short- and the other for publication and marketing of Pen-And-Paper Games called -naturally- Looking Dwarf Games or LDG as you may have guessed.</p>
        <p><img src="./puce2.png" align="bottom" alt=""/>Anyway, if you are already tired of Looking, Dwarf, and "stuff", you can still go back to something more interesting <a href="http://www.google.com">here</a></p>

        <pre>Friends of the Looking Dwarf</pre>
        <p><img src="./puce2.png" align="bottom" alt=""/>Looking Dwarf is part of a bigger thing, and has several sister companies and organization graviting around it: one of them is the Linguistic and foreign  culture Studies Departement (or LSD), which has the project, when it will go back to the ground, to publish a critically-acclaimed (well in the future that is) book about "how to survive with this guide" in many languages. Yet, LSD is still in the sky... You can find everything about the LSD here also, and check this marvelous blog of the mind behind it and -what a surprise- behind <acronym title="Looking Dwarf Software">LDS</acronym> and <acronym title="Looking Dwarf Games">LDG</acronym> as well: <a href="http://onnellinen.wordpress.com">here!</a>
