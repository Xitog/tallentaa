        <pre>Pypo, un langage rigolo</pre>
        <p><img src="./puce2.png" align="bottom" alt=""/>The Pypo Programming Language was conceived when I realized that the CLR has numerous languages, the JVM as well, but the Python platform as only one: the Python language. It's a shame because this well-designed technology using Python source file <em>(.py)</em> produces Python bytecode <em>(.pyc)</em> then executed it inside the virtual machine/interpreter. We could then build a compiler producing Python bytecode from a different language, and this language would be Pypo.</p>
        <p><img src="./puce2.png" align="bottom" alt=""/>In a first time, Pypo will have an interpreter, built with Python, and the compiler could be done later on. So now we should ask ourselves: why Pypo? Let me explain it straight: there are maybe thousands of thousands languages around there, and the main advantage of Pypo is... to have been made by me -at least for me. Because by doing it, I'm realizing an old idea, and learning a lot about lexer, parser, interpreter and AST or Abstract Syntax Tree -and I love forests, you know. Ok, that's good for me but for the others? Well, if you can't stand the Python syntax, with its horrible idea to use tabs as meaningful -but invisible- tokens and fall in love with the Python environment, which includes a lot of good libraries and useful tools, you may want to take a look at Pypo.</p>
        <p><img src="./puce2.png" align="bottom" alt=""/>Remember! Pypo is just a toy language, and is not suitable for production applications or whatever you want to do with it which is more serious than opening a beer (controlling a nuclear power plant, accounts or billing information, weaponry of any kind - in fact, Pypo will purposely defect in that case). Pypo is pipo, and pipo is pipeau, and all of them are rigolo! <i>(funny)</i></p>
